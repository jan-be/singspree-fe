// videoClock.ts — the YouTube video's time, estimated from what the IFrame
// API reports about it.
//
// The API's getCurrentTime() is not read from the video: the player in the
// iframe posts its time to the page now and then ("infoDelivery": the time
// and when it was taken), and the API extrapolates from the last report, by
// at most a second. On a starved main thread (a Fire TV Stick, where the
// iframe shares the page's thread) the reports arrive late and the time in
// them is old: measured against the video's own frames, getCurrentTime() was
// up to 3.8 s behind while the picture played smoothly. Followed as it was,
// that clock dragged the stems back and forth every half second — the
// "skipped and repeated" audio — and the lyrics with them.
//
// What makes it usable: a report is never ahead of the video. Its time can
// be stale, never early (measured: reported minus true time at the report's
// stamp ≤ +1 ms, down to −4.6 s). So every report gives a lower bound of the
// video's offset (video time − wall time), and while the video plays on
// without a jump, the highest bound seen so far is the estimate. It leaks
// downwards by 1 ms/s so a slow clock drift cannot keep an old maximum;
// measured, it stayed within ±45 ms of the picture where the API was off by
// seconds. Anything that changes the offset — a pause, buffering, a seek of
// ours, the video starting — starts a new epoch. So does a video that
// stopped moving while YouTube still says "playing" (it ran out of data: on
// the starved stick for up to 20 s, the "buffering" news seconds behind):
// reports whose time stands still are believed over the state.
//
// A video that has just started is the one exception to the rule above. Its
// time moves and then stands for a moment while the sound path comes up (read
// inside YouTube's frame: 40 ms on a desktop, after every start, seek and
// resume), so the first report sits that far above where the video then plays
// on. Taken for a bound, that lasted: nothing later reaches it, so the clock
// sank at the leak's 1 ms/s for as long as it took, 240 ms and more over a
// song, and the stems were dragged along by restarts (in the field a sixth of
// the song time on Windows and iPhones, a quarter on Android). So for its first
// SETTLE seconds an epoch follows the newest report, and the highest bound
// starts after that.
//
// The leak stays for what is left: a video that loses a moment later on (rare:
// 6 of the field's 428 slides began inside a stretch), and a starved stick,
// whose reports can come too seldom for the first second to hold a second one.
// Nothing faster will do there: its reports sit together 20-30 ms below the
// video for seconds at a time, so taking their agreement for the video's place
// made the clock wobble by that much.
