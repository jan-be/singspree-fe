/**
 * Frequency-based note storage and scoring.
 *
 * Notes are stored as raw Hz frequencies with videoTime (seconds).
 * Conversion to UltraStar semitone space happens only when needed:
 *   - Scoring: Hz → semitone for comparison against expected tone
 *   - Display: Hz → continuous semitone for Y-positioning in MusicBars
 *
 * Data structure per player (PlayerNotes):
 *   { notes: [{ videoTime, freq }], score: number }
 *
 * Scoring is time-proportional: each note sample has an implicit
 * duration (until the next sample). Score accumulates as
 *   dt * (bpm/60) * multiplier
 * when the note matches the expected tone within the singer's level's
 * tolerance (difficulty.ts).
