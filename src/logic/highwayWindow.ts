/**
 * Which ticks the note highway (MusicBars) spans for a lyric line, which
 * gives the cursor its run-up to the line's first note, and the countdown
 * to a line after a long break.
 *
 * The cursor is the moment on one scale with the notes (tickToX), so it can
 * only be seen coming if the window starts before the first note. It does:
 * the first note sits LEAD_IN_SHARE of the width in, on every line, and the
 * cursor enters at the left edge and reaches it exactly when it is to be
 * sung, at the line's own speed. A share of the width and not a time: a fixed
 * half second was a sliver on a long line and a big gap on a short one, as
 * the line's scale decides how many pixels a second is. Without the run-up
 * the first note sat at the left edge and the cursor turned up on it just as
 * the singing started (on a chart whose first note is at tick 0, nearly all
 * of them, it stood there through the whole intro).
 *
 * The window never reaches back past the end of the line before: the line is
 * shown from that moment on (a silent tick belongs to the next line,
 * LyricsParser), so lines sung back to back get the room their pause has and
 * no more (their first note further left), and nothing of the last line falls
 * into the window. The notes keep the rest of the width: they stay on their
 * ticks, only the scale changes, and only per line. A line shorter than the
 * song's minimum is widened on the right, so its first note is where every
 * other line's is.
 *
 * A finished line stays a moment longer (shownLineIndex): a singer's notes land
 * behind the cursor, by the singing delay taken off them on purpose (PartyPage)
 * and by their way here. So the cursor reaches a line's end while the last
 * fifth of a second of its last note is still to come, and with the highway
 * gone to the next line those notes were never drawn: on 39 of a song's 54
 * lines the sung line stopped short of the note it held. They count all the
 * same, it only looked as if they did not.
