/**
 * The main-thread side of painting the note highway in a worker
 * (HighwayWorker.ts): the page's canvas is handed over as an OffscreenCanvas,
 * and MusicBars paints each frame through a painter (highwayPainters.ts) that
 * either builds a WebGL scene (glScene.ts; the worker draws it with
 * highwayGL.ts) or records 2D canvas calls (canvasRecorder.ts; the worker
 * replays them). The worker says which it can once it has the canvas: WebGL
 * where it works there, 2D otherwise; until then frames are skipped.
 *
 * Why: with CPU drawing (a Fire TV stick's WebView, old iPads) the canvas's
 * paint was most of the main thread's work per frame, and its raster went into
 * the page's tiles every frame; the YouTube player shares that thread in a
 * WebView. From the worker the frame goes to the compositor on its own.
 * Recording costs the main thread a fraction of painting. With WebGL the
 * filling of the pixels moves on to the GPU as well. When the frame is built
 * matters here, see framePacer.ts.
 *
 * One frame at a time: while the worker still paints the last one, the next
 * is skipped (begin() returns null), so a slow device paints at the rate it
 * can and never queues up frames that are late. Buffers go back and forth
 * instead of being allocated per frame. A worker that stops answering (for
 * seconds and a hundred frames: not just a main thread that was stalled)
 * counts as failed.
 *
 * Where the browser cannot transfer a canvas, or the worker fails, MusicBars
 * paints on the main thread. To compare on a device, `?highway=` sets it for
 * this browser (stored): `main` (the main thread, 2D), `2d` (the worker, 2D),
 * `gl` (the worker, WebGL where it can, the default); anything else goes back
 * to the default.
