// stemSync.ts — when the stems are restarted to follow the song's clock.
//
// A restart is a jump in the music (crossfaded, see stemPlayer.ts), so it
// is only made when the stems are really off. Both clocks the stems follow
// are lower bounds of the truth: the host's video clock (videoClock.ts: a
// report can be stale, never early) and a joiner's host clock (hostClock.ts: a
// message can arrive late, never early, and the way is added at its shortest).
// So a clock ahead of the stems is proof they are behind: they follow at once.
// A clock a little behind the stems may only be late news — the old rule restarted
// the stems back on it every half second on a starved Fire TV — so that has
// to hold for a while before the stems step back. Neither clock falls a
// second behind by lateness (they keep the best news they had), so that far
// back is a seek, followed at once.

export const TOLERANCE = 0.1;    // s: what the stems may be off without a restart
export const IMMEDIATE = 0.03;   // s: a start or a seek of ours, where any difference counts
export const HOLD_BEHIND = 1.5;  // s: how long the clock must stay behind the stems before they step back
