 * The voicing decision for a stream of windows, replacing pickPitch.
 *
 * swift-f0 judges every 60 ms window alone, and a sung phrase loses each
 * window where the model wavers below 0.85: fast rap and soft or breathy
 * singing most of all. The tracker keeps listening for a moment after a window
 * it is sure of, and asks borderline windows to continue something, which is
 * what separates a voice from instruments:
 *   1. entry  confidence ≥ 0.85, but a window below 0.95 must continue the
 *             previous accepted window (≤ 35 ms, ≤ 1 semitone) or agree with
 *             its own second-to-last frame (≥ 0.85, ≤ 1 semitone). Lone
 *             borderline hits are mostly instruments.
 *   2. hold   for 0.3 s after an anchor (confidence ≥ 0.98): confidence ≥ 0.2
 *             within 2 semitones of the anchor's pitch, octave-folded.
 *   3. phrase with ≥ 0.6 s of anchors in the last 2 s: confidence ≥ 0.5.
 * Rules 2 and 3 only continue a note: a window below 0.85 needs an accepted
 * window within the last 70 ms, so they bridge a miss or two but never start
 * a note on a consonant or a breath (which drew notes starting early) or
 * stand alone (drawn as dots).
 * It only looks at this and earlier windows and always reports this window's
 * own last-frame pitch, so notes keep their time. Measured on real recordings
 * with the level calibration: singers 6/6 better on a held-out set (+279 on
 * average), note starts as early as before, no more false pitches on music
 * without a voice than pickPitch.
 *
 * `t` is the window's time in seconds on a clock that runs with the audio
 * (MicrophoneInput's chunk clock), not performance.now(): windows reach the
 * worker in bursts.
